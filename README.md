# üß† Blockade - AI-Powered Board Game

Welcome to the "Blockade" board game project, implemented in Python with artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. This project is part of the "Artificial Intelligence" course and showcases the application of AI techniques in game development.

## üìú About the Game

"Blockade" is a strategic board game where two players compete to be the last one able to make a valid move. Players take turns placing blocks on the board, attempting to block their opponent's path while keeping their own options open.

### Game Rules:

1. Players take turns placing blocks on the board.
2. A player loses if they cannot make a valid move on their turn.
3. The last player able to make a valid move wins the game.

## ü§ñ AI Implementation

This project utilizes artificial intelligence algorithms to create a challenging AI opponent. The AI analyzes the current game state and determines the optimal move using techniques such as:

- **Minimax Algorithm:** A decision-making algorithm used in game theory to minimize the possible loss for a worst-case scenario.
- **Game Tree Search:** A method that explores possible future moves to select the most favorable one.

The AI opponent adapts to different strategies, providing a dynamic and challenging experience for the player.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **AI Techniques:** Minimax Algorithm, Game Tree Search
